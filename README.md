# Wardrobe
The purpose of this project was to design a wardobe application allowing the user to input items and organize accordingly.
Due to Visual Studio errors, I did not have as much time as I needed to make this project look the way I wanted it to look.
In the Wardrobe, I organized the clothing based on type-however, knowing what I know now, would have included Tops, Bottoms, Shoes, and Accessories in the Clothing Property Controller in order to allow the user to tick which article of clothing this is.
There are controllers for each model.
There are views for: Tops, Bottoms, Shoes, and Accessories
I have photo placeholders, but they do not hold pictures of the wardrobe items-I did not have time to set this right-the placeholders are there to fulfill the thumbnails requirements.
Bootstrap navbar has been included as well as a glyphicon. Would like to add responsive images as additional bootstrap elements.
